McElroy E.; Wood T.; Bond R.; Mulvenna M.; Shevlin M.; Ploubidis G.B.; Hoffmann M.S.; Moltrecht B.,Using natural language processing to facilitate the harmonisation of mental health questionnaires: a validation study using real-world data,2024,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Pooling data from different sources will advance mental health research by providing larger sample sizes and allowing cross-study comparisons; however, the heterogeneity in how variables are measured across studies poses a challenge to this process. Methods: This study explored the potential of using natural language processing (NLP) to harmonise different mental health questionnaires by matching individual questions based on their semantic content. Using the Sentence-BERT model, we calculated the semantic similarity (cosine index) between 741 pairs of questions from five questionnaires. Drawing on data from a representative UK sample of adults (N = 2,058), we calculated a Spearman rank correlation for each of the same pairs of items, and then estimated the correlation between the cosine values and Spearman coefficients. We also used network analysis to explore the model’s ability to uncover structures within the data and metadata. Results: We found a moderate overall correlation (r =.48, p <.001) between the two indices. In a holdout sample, the cosine scores predicted the real-world correlations with a small degree of error (MAE = 0.05, MedAE = 0.04, RMSE = 0.064) suggesting the utility of NLP in identifying similar items for cross-study data pooling. Our NLP model could detect more complex patterns in our data, however it required manual rules to decide which edges to include in the network. Conclusions: This research shows that it is possible to quantify the semantic similarity between pairs of questionnaire items from their meta-data, and these similarity indices correlate with how participants would answer the same two items. This highlights the potential of NLP to facilitate cross-study data pooling in mental health research. Nevertheless, researchers are cautioned to verify the psychometric equivalence of matched items. © The Author(s) 2024.",Data pooling; Harmonisation; Meta-analysis; Retrospective data harmonisation
Hitsuwari J.; Okano H.; Nomura M.,Predicting attitudes toward ambiguity using natural language processing on free descriptions for open-ended question measurements,2024,Scientific Reports,"Individual traits and reactions to ambiguity differ and are conceptualized in terms of an individual’s attitudes toward ambiguity or ambiguity tolerance. The development of natural language processing technology has made it possible to measure mental states and reactions through open-ended questions, rather than predefined numerical rating scales, which have traditionally been the dominant method in psychological research. This study presented three ambiguity-related situations and responses collected online from 591 participants in an open-ended format. After the analysis with bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, correlations were calculated using scores from the numerical evaluation by conventional questionnaire, and a significant moderate positive correlation was found. Therefore, this study found that attitudes toward ambiguity can be measured using an open-ended response method of reporting everyday life states. It is a novel methodology that can be expanded to other scales in psychology and can potentially be used in educational and clinical situations where participants can be asked to respond with minimal burden. © The Author(s) 2024.",

It represents a heterogenous clinical syndrome that is less well understood across different ethnicities. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the clinical presentation and assess the diagnostic performance of existing HFpEF diagnostic tools between ethnic groups. Methods: A validated Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm was applied to the electronic health records of a large London hospital to identify patients meeting the European Society of Cardiology criteria for a diagnosis of HFpEF. NLP extracted patient demographics (including self-reported ethnicity and socioeconomic status), comorbidities, investigation results (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, H2FPEF scores, and echocardiogram reports), and mortality. Analyses were stratified by ethnicity and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Results: Our cohort consisted of 1,261 (64%) White, 578 (29%) Black, and 134 (7%) Asian patients meeting the European Society of Cardiology HFpEF diagnostic criteria. Compared to White patients, Black patients were younger at diagnosis and more likely to have metabolic comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) but less likely to have atrial fibrillation (30% vs 13%; P < 0.001). Black patients had lower N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels and a lower frequency of H2FPEF scores ≥6, indicative of likely HFpEF (26% vs 44%; P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Leveraging an NLP-based artificial intelligence approach to quantify health inequities in HFpEF diagnosis, we discovered that established markers systematically underdiagnose HFpEF in Black patients, possibly due to differences in the underlying comorbidity patterns. Clinicians should be aware of these limitations and its implications for treatment and trial recruitment. © 2024 The Authors",AI (artificial intelligence); health equity; heart failure; Natural Language Processing; preserved ejection fraction

The combination of these approaches yielded an natural language processing-based clinical decision support tool that can identify patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with low-risk PE as candidates for outpatient management. Methods: Data were curated from all patients who received a PE-protocol computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (PE-CTPA) imaging study in the ED of a 3-hospital academic health system between June 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020 (n=12,183). The “preliminary” radiology reports from these imaging studies made available to ED clinicians at the time of diagnosis were adjudicated as positive or negative for PE by the clinical team. The reports were then divided into development, internal validation, and temporal validation cohorts in order to train, test, and validate an natural language processing model that could identify the presence of PE based on unstructured text. For risk stratification, patient- and encounter-level data elements were curated from the electronic health record and used to compute a real-time simplified pulmonary embolism severity (sPESI) score at the time of diagnosis. Chart abstraction was performed on all low-risk PE patients admitted for inpatient management. Results: When applied to the internal validation and temporal validation cohorts, the natural language processing model identified the presence of PE from radiology reports with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99, sensitivity of 0.86 to 0.87, and specificity of 0.99. Across cohorts, 10.5% of PE-CTPA studies were positive for PE, of which 22.2% were classified as low-risk by the sPESI score. Of all low-risk PE patients, 74.3% were admitted for inpatient management. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a natural language processing-based model utilizing real-time radiology reports can accurately identify patients with PE. Further, this model, used in combination with a validated risk stratification score (sPESI), provides a clinical decision support tool that accurately identifies patients in the ED with low-risk PE as candidates for outpatient management. © 2024 American College of Emergency Physicians",
Kelbessa M.; Jebessa E.; Jahan L.,Addressing Educational Inequalities of Low SES Students: Leveraging Natural Language Processing for Impact,2024,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Socioeconomic status (SES) provides a framework for understanding an individual's work experience and socioeconomic position relative to others, considering factors such as income, education, and occupation. Low-SES significantly affects students and their education worldwide. In the United States, students from various ethnic and racial minorities, such as Hispanic, Latino, and African American populations, experience physical and psychological challenges due to low quality of life. Extensive research in various fields, particularly the social sciences, has examined diverse issues for students with low SES. Despite the profound potential of computing, particularly in natural language processing (NLP), to improve the quality of life for these individuals, NLP has yet to make substantial contributions to addressing these inequalities. In this paper, we highlighted the limited contribution of NLP compared to other disciplines in understanding and addressing the problems of low-SES students. Then, we discuss how to bridge this gap by developing NLP tools and techniques from the narratives of low-SES students, including factor and cause-effect analysis, building a knowledge graph, developing helpful apps specifically designed for them. Accomplishing this objective would represent a significant step forward in enhancing the well-being of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, we manually created and published a data set consisting of 74 posts and comments from Reddit for the NLP community to conduct proposed research on low-SES students.

Oikonomou E.D.; Karvelis P.; Giannakeas N.; Vrachatis A.; Glavas E.; Tzallas A.T.,How natural language processing derived techniques are used on biological data: a systematic review,2024,Network Modeling Analysis in Health Informatics and Bioinformatics,"The decoding of the human genome, completed two decades ago, marked a revolutionary moment in biology by introducing a vast amount of data. This avalanche of information presented several computational challenges. Machine Learning has become the dominant method to address these challenges, with Natural Language Processing playing a significant role and offering promising results. In this systematic review, we will explore the application of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to the study of biological data. On the one hand, Machine Learning is widely used in Artificial Intelligence to improve automation, carry out tasks that require no human interaction, and perform analytical and physical activities. It helps advance our understanding of biology and improve healthcare and drug development processes in bioinformatics. On the other hand, improved machine-human language interaction is the aim of Natural Language Processing. Its three main goals are character sequence processing, pattern recognition, and algorithm development. The use of Natural Language Processing is becoming increasingly important for the analysis of omics data using both modern and conventional Machine Learning models, underscoring the necessity for a systematic review. In this work, 82 studies were included following the PRISMA guidelines, sourced from PubMed, Scopus and IEEE Xplore on April 4th, 2023. The evaluation of the publications was based on the type of the studied biological data and the employed NLP techniques. Through our in-depth exploration of NLP approaches, we highlight their significance and potential in advancing the field of bioinformatics. © The Author(s) 2024.",Artificial Intelligence; Databases; Deep Learning; NLP techniques; Omics

Mukanova A.; Milosz M.; Dauletkaliyeva A.; Nazyrova A.; Yelibayeva G.; Kuzin D.; Kussepova L.,LLM-Powered Natural Language Text Processing for Ontology Enrichment,2024,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),"This paper describes a method and technology for processing natural language texts and extracting data from the text that correspond to the semantics of an ontological model. The proposed method is distinguished by the use of a Large Language Model algorithm for text analysis. The extracted data are stored in an intermediate format, after which individuals and properties that reflect the specified semantics are programmatically created in the ontology. The proposed technology is implemented using the example of an ontological model that describes the geographical configuration and administrative–territorial division of Kazakhstan. The proposed method and technology can be applied in any subject areas for which ontological models have been developed. The results of the study can significantly improve the efficiency of using knowledge bases based on semantic networks by converting texts in natural languages into semantically linked data. © 2024 by the authors.",ChatGPT; geographic question answering system; Large Language Model; natural language processing; ontology; Semantic Web
